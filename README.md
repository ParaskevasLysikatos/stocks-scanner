# Stock Speculation Scanner

A web-based tool that scans ~2,700 US stocks (S&P 500 + NASDAQ 100 + Russell 2000) and identifies the **top 10 most likely short-term gainers** based on a composite scoring system, with price targets and analyst ratings.

> **DISCLAIMER:** This is an educational/research tool. It does NOT constitute financial advice. All signals are speculative. Always do your own due diligence before making any investment decisions.

## What It Does

Scores each stock 0–100 using four signals:

| Signal | Weight | Logic |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Technical | 35% | RSI recovering (30–50), MACD bullish crossover, price above 50-day MA |
| Volume Spike | 25% | Today's volume > 2x the 20-day average |
| Sentiment | 25% | News + Reddit buzz via TextBlob polarity |
| Fundamentals | 15% | P/E < 40, earnings within 7 days (catalyst) |

Returns the top 10 highest-scoring stocks with:
- **Composite score** and per-signal breakdowns
- **Current price** and **52-week range** (visual position indicator)
- **Analyst price target** with upside/downside percentage
- **Analyst consensus rating** (Strong Buy / Buy / Hold / Sell)
- **Smart notes**: Near 52W low, Analyst upside %, Analyst Buy consensus, volume spikes, earnings catalysts

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) + Docker Compose

No API keys, no database, no accounts needed. All data sources are free.

## How to Run

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Then open **http://localhost** in your browser.

## How to Use

1. Click **"Scan Market"**
2. Wait 10–15 minutes (the scanner processes ~2,700 tickers sequentially to avoid rate limiting)
3. View the top 10 results table with scores, prices, targets, and ratings

**Recommended usage:** Once daily, before US market open (09:30 ET).

## Results Table Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Score | Composite 0–100 score across all signals |
| Price | Current stock price |
| 52W Range | 52-week low — high with dot showing current price position |
| Target | Mean analyst price target with upside % |
| Rating | Analyst consensus: Strong Buy, Buy, Hold, Sell |
| Technical | Technical signal score (out of 35) |
| Volume | Volume spike score (out of 25) |
| Sentiment | News/social sentiment score (out of 25) |
| Fundamentals | P/E + earnings catalyst score (out of 15) |
| Notes | Key signals: volume spikes, analyst buy, near 52W low, etc. |

## Architecture

```
Frontend (Vue 3 + Nginx, port 80)
  └── /api/* proxied to ──→ Backend (FastAPI + Uvicorn, port 8000)
```

- **Frontend**: Vue 3 (Vite build) served by Nginx
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Uvicorn (Python 3.13)
- **Communication**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time progress
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose (two services, single exposed port :80)

## Data Sources (all free, no API keys)

| Source | Data | Method |
|--------|------|--------|
| yfinance | Price, volume, fundamentals, news, analyst targets, ratings | Python library |
| Finviz | News headlines, screener fallback (Russell 2000) | Web scraping |
| Reddit | r/stocks + r/wallstreetbets mention frequency & sentiment | Public .json API |
| Wikipedia | S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 ticker lists | pandas read_html |
| iShares | Russell 2000 ETF holdings | CSV download |

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/scan` | POST | Start a full market scan (returns SSE stream) |
| `/api/health` | GET | Health check |
| `/api/logs` | GET | Per-source request stats + recent failures |

## Monitoring & Logs

- **`GET /api/logs`** — Returns per-source success/fail stats and the last 50 failed external requests
- **`logs/external_requests.log`** — JSON-lines audit of every external HTTP request with timestamp, source, URL, status code, latency, and success/failure
- **`logs/scanner.log`** — General application log (rotating, 5MB max, 3 backups)
- **SSE summary event** — Per-source request summary sent to frontend at scan completion

## .gitignore

The following are excluded from version control:
- `logs/` — runtime log files
- `node_modules/` — frontend dependencies
- `dist/` — frontend build output
- `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc` — Python bytecode
- `.env` — environment variables

## Limitations

- Rate limiting may cause some sources to be skipped (graceful degradation — Reddit is heavily rate-limited)
- Data is only as fresh as the last scan (no real-time streaming)
- Sentiment analysis uses simple TextBlob polarity (not ML-based)
- Analyst targets are consensus averages — individual analyst accuracy varies
- This is a speculative screener, not a prediction engine — past signals don't guarantee future price movement
